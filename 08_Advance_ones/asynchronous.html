    Synchronous Programming 

    You have a web application that displays user profiles. To get the profile data, you need to fetch it
    from a server. If you use synchronous programming for this task, the entire application will freeze until
    the data is fetched and processed.

    When a synchronous request is made to fetch user profile data, the entire application is halted until the data
    is fetched and processed.

    No other operations can be performed during this time, leading to a frozen UI.



    Asynchronous programming :
    
    When an asynchronous request is made, the application continues to run other tasks while waiting for the 
    server response. The main thread is not blocked, allowing the user to interact with the application.

    The user can continue to interact with the application, such as clicking buttons, scrolling, or entering data,
    while the profile data is being fetched.


    -- Responsiveness: Keeps the UI responsive, allowing users to interact with the app even while waiting
       for operations to complete.

    -- Efficiency: Allows handling multiple tasks concurrently, improving the overall efficiency of the application.

    -- User Experience: Enhances the user experience by preventing the application from freezing or becoming
       unresponsive during long operations.


    JavaScript offers several mechanisms for asynchronous programming
 
    -- setTimeout: Executes a function after a specified delay.
    -- setInterval: Repeatedly executes a function with a fixed time delay between each call.

    -- Promises: Represents a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never. 
       Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations more effectively.

    -- fetch: Provides a modern way to make HTTP requests and handle responses. It returns a Promise.

    -- axios: A popular library for making HTTP requests, which returns Promises and has additional
       features like interceptors.

    -- XMLHttpRequest: An older way to make HTTP requests. It's more complex and less modern than fetch.


    Why Asynchronous Programming is Needed

    * Responsiveness :

    Asynchronous programming keeps the UI responsive, allowing users to interact with the application even
    while waiting for operations to complete. For example, when fetching user data from a server, the UI
    can remain interactive, displaying a loading indicator until the data arrives.
    
    * Efficiency

    Allows handling multiple tasks concurrently, improving the overall efficiency of the application.
    For instance, an application can fetch data, listen for user input, and perform animations simultaneously
    without one task blocking the others.
    
    * User Experience

    Enhances the user experience by preventing the application from freezing or becoming unresponsive during
    long operations. Asynchronous programming ensures that long-running tasks, such as network requests or complex
    calculations, do not block the main thread, keeping the application smooth and responsive.

    JavaScript Promises :

    A new Promise is created with the Promise constructor, which takes a function with two parameters: resolve and reject.

    The .then() method is used to handle the successful resolution of the Promise
    The .catch() method is used to handle the rejection of the Promise.
