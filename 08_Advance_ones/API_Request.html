        API Requests:

        An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software
        applications to communicate and interact with each other. 
        
        In the context of web development, APIs are commonly used to request and exchange data between
        a client (usually a web browser or a mobile app) and a server.

        API requests are a way for the client to request specific data or perform certain actions from the server. 
        This is typically done using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. 

        The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data or performs
        the requested action.


        V8 Engine:

        The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. 

        It is at the core of many modern web browsers, including Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers, 
        as well as Node.js. The primary purpose of the V8 engine is to execute JavaScript code in these environments.

        The V8 engine is responsible for translating JavaScript code into machine code that the computer's processor 
        can execute.

        It uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to optimize the performance of JavaScript execution.
        
        Because of its efficiency and speed, the V8 engine significantly improves the performance of JavaScript
        applications and allows developers to build complex and high-performance web applications.
        
        In summary, API requests and the V8 engine are both essential components of modern web development. 

        API requests enable communication and data exchange between clients and servers, while the V8 engine optimizes
        the execution of JavaScript code, making it possible to build fast and efficient web applications.

    /* 
       XMLHttpRequest (XHR) approach, is considered the older way of making HTTP requests in JavaScript.
       While XHR is still fully functional and supported in all browsers, the Fetch API is the more modern and
       preferred method for making network requests due to its simplicity and ease of use.
